**<u>Reading (Getting Started)</u>**

This topic matters because it helps to understand not just the basics of "how to" but to deepen your understanding of how it actually works as a body of information.

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.
   the browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client (you go to the shop and order your goods).
2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
   Critical Rendering path is the sequence of actions or steps performed by the browser in order to render a web page on the screen. These steps include fetching resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from the server, parsing received HTML to create DOM, parsing CSS to create CSSOM, creating Render Tree which is the combination of DOM and CSSOM, calculating positioning and dimensions (Layout) of all elements, and finally Painting actual pixels on the screen.
   Parsed-analyze (a string or text) into logical syntactic components, typically in order to test conformability to a logical grammar.
3. How can you find images to add to a Website?
   You can search in google images to find an image suitable for your web design.
   To choose an image, go to Google Images and search for something suitable.

When you find the image you want, click on the image to get an enlarged view of it.
Right-click the image (Ctrl + click on a Mac), choose Save Image As…, and choose a safe place to save your image. Alternatively, copy the image's web address from your browser's address bar for later use.

4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
   You create a string by inputing "" or '' around text or numbers. You create a number by simply inputting a number. Number lack quotes around them.

5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?
   Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable.

Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image displayed in an image
gallery.

_Intro To HTML_

1. What is an HTML attribute?
   An attribute contains extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.

   An attribute should have:

A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)
The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.

2. Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.
The anatomy of an HTML element includes an openin tag, content, and a closing tag. An example would be
<ul></ul>

3. What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?
An article encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post) while a section is similar to <article>, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries), or a theme. 

4. What Elements does a “typical” website include?
Elements included in a typicak website would be the head, body, main, and footer.

5. How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?
The description is also used on search engine result pages.

6. How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata? 
Two such meta elements that are useful to include on your page define the author of the page, and provide a concise description of the page. Using name and content.
