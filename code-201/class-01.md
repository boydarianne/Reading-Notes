**<u>Reading (Getting Started)</u>**

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.
the browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client (you go to the shop and order your goods).
2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
Critical Rendering path is the sequence of actions or steps performed by the browser in order to render a web page on the screen. These steps include fetching resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from the server, parsing received HTML to create DOM, parsing CSS to create CSSOM, creating Render Tree which is the combination of DOM and CSSOM, calculating positioning and dimensions (Layout) of all elements, and finally Painting actual pixels on the screen. 
Parsed-analyze (a string or text) into logical syntactic components, typically in order to test conformability to a logical grammar.
3. How can you find images to add to a Website?
You can search in google images to find an image suitable for your web design.
To choose an image, go to Google Images and search for something suitable.

When you find the image you want, click on the image to get an enlarged view of it.
Right-click the image (Ctrl + click on a Mac), choose Save Image As…, and choose a safe place to save your image. Alternatively, copy the image's web address from your browser's address bar for later use.

4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
You create a string by inputing "" or '' around text or numbers. You create a number by simply inputting a number. Number lack quotes around them.

5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?
Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable.

Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.
