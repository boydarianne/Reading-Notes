<u>What Went Wrong?</u> 

<strong>Troubleshooting JavaScript.</strong>

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

One of the key differences between a Syntax error and a logic error is that a syntax error would usually be easier to find due to receiving direction within your console.log and it usually has to do with incorrect spelling or something similarly simple while logic errors will run successfully but not produce the correct results. This is harder because there is no guide to where this error may be.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

I have run into an error where my style.css sheet was not being recognized and I had to fix it by ensuring that I had to correct file path listed in the link and header of the HTML file.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

I believe this topic will lend itself to my long term goals by way of allowing me to understand that difference between syntax and logic now so that when I run into this issue, I can handle it accordingly rather than spending more time confused because I was not made aware of the logic style error more specifically.

<u>The JavaScript Debugger.</u>

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

3. What is the call stack?

It is a data structure used to keep track of the sequence of function calls and their corresponding execution contexts in a computer program.
