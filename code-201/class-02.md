<u>Introduction To HTML</u>

This information is important because it will allow my understanding of html, css, and javascript to deepen which directly effects how well I am able to implement the knowledge.

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
It is impportant to use semantic elements so that we understand or rather, the computer understands, what particular function our content is to be. (example:the h1 element is also a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page.")
2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?
There are 6 level headings in HTML.
3. What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?
To mark up items like dates, formulas, and mathmatical equations.
4. When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?
The titel attribute.

<u>Learn CSS:</u>
1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
Internally, externally, and inline.
2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?
First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.
3. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

What is representing the selector? h2
Which components are the CSS declarations? the curly braces {}
Which components are considered properties? color and background

<u>Learn JS</u>
