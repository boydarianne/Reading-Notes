<strong><u>Video and Audio Content</u></strong>

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
Previously, developers used proprietary plugin-based technology which, due to security and accesibility issues, it had to be discontinued. Thus, HTML elements such as audio and video are the current use. 
2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
src attrtibute is present to contain the link to the video that you want to show on your webpage.(embed) and controls allows for the video to have physical pause and play buttons as well a volume. (audio video playback)
3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
fallback content ensures that the users can have access to the video regardless of whether they have a newer browser or an older one. It allows the addition of a second video link that they can use.
4. Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.
Audio and Video are a pretty cool couple that I have had the pleasure to meet. Audio can be very quiet but also very loud depending on the situation and the cool thing is, she usually listens very well to commands that tell her what level she needs to be on. Video on the otherhand, is a pretty cool guy. What makes audio and visual so similar is that they are both quite easily controlled and they possess characteristics that allows them to mesh with any browser. Video has something that audio doesn't and that is moving pictures. Video somehwat makes up for audio in that way but together they are dynamic!

<u>Responsive Images</u>

How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
srcset and sizes are used to set multiple source images with hints which allows the browser to choose the correct one. srcset is more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JS because it requires more effort and complexity.
