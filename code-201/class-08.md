<u>Learn CSS - Flexbox</u>

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
Flexbox primarily deals with laying out elements in a single row or a single column. This is the "one-dimensional" aspect of Flexbox. It excels at distributing space and aligning items along this chosen axis.
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column.
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
Properties such as row-reverse or column-reverse reorders the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document. This can negatively impact accessibility. 

<u>CSS-layout Flexbox‚Äù</u>

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
Flexbox has the ability to deliver conveniences such as:
Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
I believe this topic connects with my long term goals by way of allowing me to simplify the process of design on different web pages that I encounter. I can already think of a moment in my about-me project where this could have been helpful. I used float in the first section of my page and while it worked to have my image float, I had trouble formatting the section with the words that were also in it.
