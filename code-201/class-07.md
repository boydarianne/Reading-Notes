<u>Domain Modeling:</u>

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
Domain modeling is helpful for analysis and often a good conceptual model for system design.

<u>HTML Table Bascis</u>

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
It reduces accessibility for the visually impaired, tables produce "tag soup" which is  result of complex mark up structures leaving the code to be harder to write, , maintain, and debug, and they are not automatically responsive. 
"When you use proper layout containers (such as <header>, <section>, <article>, or <div>), their width defaults to 100% of their parent element. Tables on the other hand are sized according to their content by default, so extra measures are needed to get table layout styling to effectively work across a variety of devices."

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
<td>- being the smallest container inside of a table known as the table cell, can be made to create a row of cells even though in the html document it will look as though they are stacked on top of each other. Every cell added makes the row longer. 
<tr>- stands for table row. this element allows us to stop the previous row from growing and start placing subsequent cells on the second row.
<th>- stands for table header. is used to recognize the table headers as headers, both visually and semantically. 

<u>Introducing Constructors:</u>

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
Constructors a special method that is used to initialize objects
An advantage of contrsuctors is the ability to create more than one object from a single object definition.
2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor? When used in an object literal it is the equivalent of the object name that it is encased in. When it is used in a contstructor it allows the user to be able to "call" on the object name within separate objects. 

<strong><u>Object Protoypes Using A Constructor</u></strong>

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
