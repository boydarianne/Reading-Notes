<srtong><u>Javascript Object Basics</u></strong>

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with? An object is a javascript language which allows you to store information that uses a name and a value. For example the if you wanted to store information such as someones age, the word "age" would be considered the name and the actual age of the person would be considered the value.

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals? Some advantages would include "Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name."

3. How do objects differ from arrays? Objects represent “things” with characteristics (aka properties), while arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable.

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.  if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation.

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this? this refers to the name of the object which is dog and the age name written within the object. The advantage to using it is it allows you to use the same method definition for every object you create.

<strong><u>Intro to DOM:</u></strong>

1. What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.
