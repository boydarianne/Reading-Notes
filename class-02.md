What are four important features to look for in a text editor? : 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.
What do the following commands do?
pwd- Print working directory (It tells you what your current or present working directory is.)
ls- What's in Our Current Location
cd- move around in the system
mkdir- Creates a directory or subdirectory.
touch- It is used to create a file without any content.
Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
cd projects
mkdir new-project
touch new-project/newfile.md
cd ..
ls projects/new-project
We found the directory fpr projects
created a directory for projects
using touch we created a file for projects or found the file.
finally, using cd .. we told the computer to go to a parent directory.


**Additional Notes**
Terminal is like a file explorer and allows different task such as:
1. Find files, or file content
2. change directories
3. move and copy files
4. open files
5. make new files and folders
