1. What is HTML and why do we use it?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. HTML is comprised of a head, header, body, main, and footer. It can be compared to the skeleton of the human body.

2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?
The opening tag, the content, and then the closing tag. Example would be if you want to write a statement to be stand alone you could put the opening tag <p> for paragraph and the content couls be "i love you" the closing tag would follow </p>

3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?
It is called an attribute. 
Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.

4. What is a semantic element?
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code.
In HTML, for example, the h1 element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
