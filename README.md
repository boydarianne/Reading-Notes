## Hello! My name is Ari, short for Arianne. I am from New Orleans, LA and I am super excited about the courses at CodeX. I have come across coders before and I could'nt imagine being able to understand what they were looking at but it is super exciting to know that I will be able to now!
## *"Growth Mindset"* 
## A growth mindset has everything to do with being comfortable being flexible. It requires that you embrace new ideas and constantly seek ways to challenege yourself. I always challenge myself by challenging my fears. I absolutely love it. If there is something I am afraid to take on I usually run in that direction because I see it as an opportunity to expand and while I have made some "mistakes" by acting in t hat way, those "mistakes" have always proved to be the things that propeled me further and changed my way of thinking for the better.
## *Three reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset:*
### 1. There is something gain from every experience whether it is good or bad. 
### 2. Understand that development takes time so its important to be patient and know that you are making progress even when it may feel like you are not.
### 3.  Always stop to acknoweldge what you HAVE accomplished. It helps to focus on the progress you havae made over focusing on what you have not done yet.
