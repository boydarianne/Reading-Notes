# *"Growth Mindset"* 
### A growth mindset has everything to do with being comfortable being flexible. It requires that you embrace new ideas and constantly seek ways to challenege yourself. I always challenge myself by challenging my fears. I absolutely love it. If there is something I am afraid to take on I usually run in that direction because I see it as an opportunity to expand and while I have made some "mistakes" by acting in t hat way, those "mistakes" have always proved to be the things that propeled me further and changed my way of thinking for the better.
# *Three reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset:*
### 1. There is something gain from every experience whether it is good or bad. 2. Understand that development takes time so its important to be patient and know that you are making progress even when it may feel like you are not. 3. Always stop to acknoweldge what you HAVE accomplished. It helps to focus on the progress you havae made over focusing on what you have not done yet.
